A complete disassembly of the Amiga CD32 game: Alien Breed 92 - Special Edition by Team 17.

This is not fully decoded yet but it can be re-assembled into a fully working game<br>
(windows tools, batch script and all assets are provided).

I made a few changes to the original game:

- Removed the cheat codes and added a debug mode.
- Fixed the bug in level 6 (no more evil smiley).

A work in progress...
